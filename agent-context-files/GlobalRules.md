# Global Rules

## Code Style

- Comments in English only
- Prefer functional programming over OOP
- Use OOP classes only for connectors and interfaces to external systems
- Write pure functions - only modify return values, never input parameters or global state
- Follow DRY, KISS, and YAGNI principles
- Use strict typing everywhere - function returns, variables, collections
- Check if logic already exists before writing new code
- Avoid untyped variables and generic types
- Never use default parameter values - make all parameters explicit
- Create proper type definitions for complex data structures
- All imports at the top of the file
- Write simple single-purpose functions - no multi-mode behavior, no flag parameters that switch logic

## Error Handling

- Always raise errors explicitly, never silently ignore them
- Use specific error types that clearly indicate what went wrong
- Avoid catch-all exception handlers that hide the root cause
- Error messages should be clear and actionable
- No fallbacks unless I explicitly ask for them
- Fix root causes, not symptoms
- External API or service calls: use retries with warnings, then raise the last error
- Error messages must include enough context to debug: request params, response body, status codes
- Logging should use structured fields instead of interpolating dynamic values into message strings

## Language Specifics

- Prefer structured data models over loose dictionaries
- Avoid generic types like `Any`, `unknown`, or `List[Dict[str, Any]]`
- Use modern package management files like `pyproject.toml` and `package.json`
- Use the language's strict type features when available

## Libraries and Dependencies

- Install dependencies in project environments, not globally
- Add dependencies to project config files, not as one-off manual installs
- If a dependency is installed locally, read its source code when needed instead of guessing
- Update project configuration files when adding dependencies

## Terminal Usage

- Prefer non-interactive commands with flags over interactive ones
- Always use non-interactive git diff: `git --no-pager diff` or `git diff | cat`
- Prefer `rg` for searching code and files

## Claude Code Workflow

- Read the existing code and relevant `CLAUDE.md` files before editing
- Keep changes minimal and related to the current request
- Match the existing style of the repository even if it differs from my personal preference
- Do not revert unrelated changes
- If you are unsure, inspect the codebase instead of inventing patterns
- When project instructions include test or lint commands, run them before finishing if the task changed code

## Documentation

- Code is the primary documentation - use clear naming, types, and docstrings
- Keep documentation in docstrings of the functions or classes they describe, not in separate files
- Separate docs files only when a concept cannot be expressed clearly in code
- Never duplicate documentation across files
- Store knowledge as current state, not as a changelog of modifications
